The biggest motivation to change my career has been the stagnant wage growth.
My boss started me off with a really low salary and promised to increase it once I had more
experience. After my first year there, COVID-19 hit so they only gave me a 1.85% "raise."
This year, I got 2.3%. There is no negotiating salaries in corporate America, so I decided
to venture into the more progressive tech industry instead.
